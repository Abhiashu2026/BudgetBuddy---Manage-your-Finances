# Demo Screenshot Placeholder

To add your own application screenshot:

1. Take a screenshot of your running Expense Tracker application
2. Save it as `demo-screenshot.png` in this directory
3. Replace this placeholder file

A good screenshot should showcase:

- The main dashboard with financial overview
- Charts visualization
- Some sample transactions

This will enhance your GitHub repository appearance and help users understand your application's interface at a glance.
